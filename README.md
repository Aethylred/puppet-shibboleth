# Shibboleth

[Shibboleth](http://shibboleth.net/) is among the world's most widely deployed federated identity solutions, connecting users to applications both within and between organizations. Every software component of the Shibboleth system is free and open source.

Shibboleth is an open-source project that provides Single Sign-On capabilities and allows sites to make informed authorization decisions for individual access of protected on-line resources in a privacy-preserving manner.

# The Shibboleth Puppet Module

The Shibboleth Puppet module is intended as a companion module to the [PuppetLabs Apache module](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apache) that manages the Shibboleth services used by Service Providers (SP) and Identity Providers (IDp) in a manner consistent and compatible with the usage of the Puppetlabs Apache Module. Once this module is installed and configured it should just be a matter of specifying `authType shibboleth` in an Apache Virtual Host declaration.

These shibboleth services are tightly bound to the installation of the Shibboleth Apache module `mod_shib` so the resources provided in this module are dependent on the use of the `apache::mod::shib` class from the PuppetLabs Apache module.

# Example Usage

The following is an example installation:

```puppet
# Set up Apache
class{'apache': }
class{'apache::mod::shib': }

# Initialise Shibboleth configuration and services
class{'shibboleth': }

# Set up the Shibboleth Single Sign On (sso) module
shibboleth::sso{'federation_directory':
  discoveryURL  => 'https://example.federation.org/ds/DS',
}

shibboleth::metadata{'federation_metadata':
  provider_uri  => 'https://example.federation.org/metadata/fed-metadata-signed.xml',
  cert_uri      => 'http://example.federation.org/metadata/fed-metadata-cert.pem',
}

shibboleth::attribute_map{'federation_attribute_map':
  map_uri => 'https://example.federation.org/download/attribute-map.xml',
}

include shibboleth::backend_cert
```

## Example Usage Breakdown

The following sections describe the sequence given in the Example Usage

### Apache and Shibboleth

```puppet
# Set up Apache
class{'apache': }
class{'apache::mod::shib': }
```

Setting up the `apache` class from the PuppetLabs Apache Module is a requirement, no extra configuration is required, though it is recommended that the `serveradmin` parameter is set.

This is followed by installing the Shibboleth module (`mod_shib`) for Apache. This provides the absolute minimum installation. It is `apache::mod::shib` that installs the required packages for Shibboleth and the `shibd` service.

**Note:** There are no packages for Shibboleth provided for RedHat distributions in their default repositories. A [suitable repository](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPLinuxRPMInstall) must be provided.

## Initialise Shibboleth configuration and services

```puppet
class{'shibboleth': }
```

This sets up the Shibboleth configuration, and maintains the `shibd` service.

## Configure Single Sign On with a Discovery Service

```puppet
# Set up the Shibboleth Single Sign On (SSO) module
shibboleth::sso{'federation_directory':
  discoveryURL  => 'https://example.federation.org/ds/DS',
}
```

This snippet sets up a Single Sign On (SSO) service that uses a Directory Service to handle multiple federated Identity Providers (IDp). 

*Note:* The URL is an example only, the Federation should provide the correct URL to use for its directory service.

*Note:* Alternatively if only a single IDp is to be used, use the `idpURL` parameter instead. The `idpURL` and `discoveryURL` parameters are mutually exclusive, the SSO can only use one or the other.

## Federation Metadata and Certificate

```
shibboleth::metadata{'federation_metadata':
  provider_uri  => 'https://example.federation.org/metadata/fed-metadata-signed.xml',
  cert_uri      => 'http://example.federation.org/metadata/fed-metadata-cert.pem',
}
```

Currently `shibboleth::metadata` only supports a single metadata provider, but it is possible to configure Shibboleth to use multiple metadata in a co-federated environment, hence this has been defined as a resource to permit multiple declarations. This resource requires two URIs, one to obtain the Federation metadata XML file, and another to obtain the Federation metadata signing certificate.

# Updating the Attribute map

```puppet
shibboleth::attribute_map{'federation_attribute_map':
  map_uri => 'https://example.federation.org/download/attribute-map.xml',
}
```

This is optional, and will allow `mod_shib` to use a customised attribute map downloaded from the provided URI. By default this is updated every 21 days. The parameter `max_age` can be used to set the number of days between updates.

# Create the Back-end x509 Certificate

```
include shibboleth::backend_cert
```

This creates a self signed back-end x509 certificate and key with which this Service Provider can be registered with a Federation. This method currently just runs the `shib-keygen` command with the values supplied by the `shibboleth` declaration. This certificate will be regenerated on a new deployment unless it has been saved or backed up.

It is recommended that rather than use this class, a specified certificate is deployed by Puppet from a private file server, or using a suitable x509 certificate management Puppet Module. Maintaining the back-end certificate is important as this is how a Service Provider identifies itself to other Shibboleth services.

The following snippet uploads a certificate, and uses parameters to configure Shibboleth to use it:

```puppet
class{'apache':
  servername => 'example.com'
}

class{'apache::mod::shib: '}

file{'/etc/shibboleth/example.com.crt':
  ensure => 'file',
  owner  => $::shibboleth::user,
  group  => $::shibboleth::group,
  mode   => '0644',
  source => 'puppet:///private/example.com.crt'
}

class{'shibboleth':
  sp_cert  => 'example.com.crt'
}
```

# Classes and Resources

The `shibboleth` module provides the following classes and resource definitions:

## Class: `shibboleth`

## Resource: `shibboleth::sso`

### Prameters for `shibboleth::sso`
* `discoveryURL`        The URL of the discovery service, is undefined by default
* `idpURL`              The URL of a single IDp, is undefined by default
